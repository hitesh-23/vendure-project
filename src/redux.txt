Q.What is redux?
  Redux is used for state management



Q. Why Redux?
    if using normal hooks, we can pass the data from parent to child component

    With prop drilling we have to pass the data to all components

    with useContext we have provider and useContext

    In redux we will store data in separate redux store and we will get the data frm store whenever needed.

Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state using events called 'actions'.
it serves as a centralised store for state that needs to be used across your entire application with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predicatable fashion.

Redux main topics
Action - it tells us what to do.
reducer - it shows how to do
Store - Object which holds the state of the application
Functions associated with store - createStore(), dispatch(action), getState()
